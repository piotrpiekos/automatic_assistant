process_csv(path_to_file: str, task: str) -> str # open csv file in 'path_to_file', process it as specified in natural language in 'task', can return a string
save_to_file(text: str, path: str) -> None # saves 'text' to the file in path 'path'

Generate a list of actions to take in order to fulfill the task given by the user that are closely related to the actions above. You can use natural language but each step should more or less correspond to one operation from the list above'
Don't save anything to variables, don't use variables at all. Assume you have access to everything that has been calculated previously.
Don't write anything apart from the list. Separate each point in the list by newline token. Don't write separate steps for opening the files.
